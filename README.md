# Body-Mass-Index-BMI
Here's a complete Python code for calculating Body Mass Index (BMI) and providing the user's condition based on the calculated BMI
In this code, we have three main functions:
1. "calculate_bmi": This function takes the weight and height as input and returns the calculated BMI.
2. "get_condition": This function takes the calculated BMI as input and returns the corresponding condition based on the BMI value.
3. "main": This is the main function where the user is prompted to enter their weight and height, and then the BMI is calculated using the "calculate_bmi" function. The BMI and the user's condition are then printed as output.

To run this code, simply copy and paste it into a Python environment and execute it. You will be prompted to enter your weight and height, and the code will provide the calculated BMI and your condition based on the BMI value.
