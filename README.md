## Introduction
The Body Mass Index (BMI) is a measure that relates a person's weight and height to determine if they have a healthy body weight. It is widely used as an indicator of whether an individual is underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese. The BMI calculation provides a numerical value that helps assess the risk of developing certain health conditions associated with weight.

## Explanation
The provided Python code calculates the BMI based the weight and height entered by the user. It then determines the user's condition (underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese) based on the calculated BMI value.

The code consists of three main functions:
1. `calculate_bmi(weight, height)`: This function takes the weight and height as input and returns the calculated BMI.
2. `get_condition(bmi)`: This function takes the calculated BMI as input and returns the corresponding condition based on the BMI value.
3. `main()`: This is the main function where the user is prompted to enter their weight and height. The BMI is calculated using the `calculate_bmi` function, and the user's BMI and condition are printed as output.
